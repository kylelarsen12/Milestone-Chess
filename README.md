# Milestone-Chess

Making a browser chess game
Currently behaves mostly like an in person chess game

Todo:
-Add drag and drop for pieces
-Add separate functions for selecting squares and moving pieces to the square
-Implement more specific rules (castling, en passant, draw conditions)
-Enforce whose turn it is (disable moving pieces if wrong color)
-Enforce legal moves like chess websites
**Utilize numberedFiles Array in conjunction with ranks in order to give numerical coordinate to pieces
**Simple arithmetic on coordinate pair (each piece would have [x,y]) to calculate legal moves
-Add sounds for above scenarios
-Add chess clock
